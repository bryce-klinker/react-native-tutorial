# Overview 

At this point we have a react-native application with no real functionality. Let's go ahead and add some functionality.

# Application

The application we are going to be building is an application that will show various information about football (soccer) players, clubs, and competitions.

## First User Story

As an Arsenal fan
I want to view Arsenal's position in the Premier League
So that I know if they will reach the champions league next year

### Getting started

For this story we can plan to simply show a small league table when the app starts. 

We don't plan to add any interaction logic or anything of that kind. We will just show a league table from an api that could be
built at a later date. 

**NOTE**: We will use a mock api instead of a real rest api. This will allow us some nice flexibility throughout the tutorial.

#### Writing our first unit test

I prefer to use enzyme to test react components as I find the api for enzyme to be more natural than the one provided with react-test-renderer. Let's go ahead and add enzyme to our packages:

```bash
# Open a terminal and execute:
yarn add enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16 --dev --exact # installs enzyme and adapter. Saving as dev dependencies with exact version numbers
```
